# RolerBot
This bot assigns roles based on the user's reaction. The `listener.py` listens to a specific channel's message for reactions, and the `message.py` creates a new message for reactions or updates the existing message in that channel.

Create an `.env` file with the variable `TOKEN` using your bot token to get it started.
